            <div class="bio">
                <p>Hello! My name is Leonid Nasevski, and I am currently a college student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI) in Skopje, Macedonia. I hail from the picturesque city of Prilep, known for its rich history and cultural heritage.</p>
                <p>Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our world. This passion led me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, a field that perfectly blends my interests in problem-solving, creativity, and innovation. At FINKI, I am acquiring a solid foundation in various aspects of software development, including programming, algorithms, data structures, and system design.</p>
                <p>My journey in software engineering has been both challenging and rewarding. I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects that have helped me develop my technical skills and teamwork abilities. One of my key strengths is my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and environments, which has proven invaluable in an ever-evolving field like software engineering.</p>
